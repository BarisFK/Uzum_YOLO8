# Grape Detection Computer Vision Project

This computer vision project is designed to detect and analyze grape bunches, bruises, stems, and leaves using the YOLOv8 model. The project includes several Python scripts that utilize OpenCV and the Ultralytics YOLO implementation for real-time image processing and object detection.

## Project Structure

- testLive.py - This script uses a webcam to perform real-time detection of objects. It visualizes the detection results on each frame captured from the webcam.
- testCoordinat.py - Focuses on detecting specific classes (in this case, grape bunches) and prints their coordinates on the screen.
- testCenterPoint.py - Draws a rectangle and a center point on a static image to illustrate object detection results.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Ultralytics YOLO library

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
pip install opencv-python-headless ultralytics
